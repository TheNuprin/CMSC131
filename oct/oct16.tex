Today, we'll continue talking about arrays.

\subsection{Resizing Arrays}

When we initialize an array with a fixed size, this size cannot be changed. For example, the following code will not compile:

\begin{lstlisting}
public class Example {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = new int[10]; /* Declare an array of size 10. */
        arr.length += 5; /* THIS DOESN'T WORK! */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

We cannot increment the \verb!length! variable associated with an array; it is declared as a constant variable with the \verb!final! keyword. So, how do we resize an array? We need to create a completely new array, and copy over the elements.
